Therefore, it is not possible to identify a relevant reference step from the demonstration that matches the current state image.</ref_think>\n<ref>n/a</ref>\n<score_think>n/a</score_think>\n<score>n/a</score>", "meta_data": {"id": "h5_tienkung_xsens_1rgb/push_bewak_pick_machine_place_plate/2024-10-21-13-49-30", "task_goal": "serving a slice of pizza", "stage_to_estimate": "/projects/p32958/chengxuan/data/images/h5_tienkung_xsens_1rgb/push_bewak_pick_machine_place_plate/2024-10-21-13-49-30/camera_top_0724.jpg", "status": "success"}}
