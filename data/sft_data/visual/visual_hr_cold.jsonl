This is a clear progression from the first image.\n\n3. **Demo Image 3**: The robotic arm is still holding the pear above the tray, but it appears to be in a slightly different position, suggesting a continuation of the same action or preparation for the next step.\n\n4. **Demo Image 4**: The robotic arm has completed the action of placing the pear into the tray. The pear is now inside the tray, and the arm is moving away, indicating the task is finished.\n\nNow, examining the current state image:\n- The robotic arm is holding the pear above the tray, similar to Demo Image 2 and Demo Image 3.\n- However, the position of the arm and the pear appears to be slightly different from both Demo Image 2 and Demo Image 3, suggesting a transitional phase between these two images.\n\nGiven these observations, the current state is most similar to Demo Image 2, as the robotic arm is actively holding the pear above the tray, preparing to place it inside.\n\n</ref_think>\n<ref>2</ref>\n<score_think>\nComparing the current state to Demo Image 2:\n- The robotic arm is holding the pear above the tray, which matches the action in Demo Image 2.\n- However, the current state shows a slight difference in the arm's position, suggesting that the task is not exactly at the same stage as Demo Image 2 but is progressing toward the next step.\n\nGiven that the current state is slightly more advanced than Demo Image 2 but not yet at the stage of Demo Image 3, it indicates a progression beyond the 33% mark but not quite reaching the 67% mark. Therefore, the progress is estimated to be around the midpoint between these two frames.\n\n</score_think>\n<score>44%</score>", "meta_data": {"id": "h5_ur_1rgb/put_pear_in_top_white_drawer/1021_173637", "task_goal": "placing a pear in a drawer", "status": "success"}}

However, the current state image shows the object being held slightly higher, suggesting that the task is in a slightly earlier stage of this mid-progress phase compared to Image 2.\n\nGiven this analysis, the closest reference frame is Image 2, as it most closely resembles the current state of the task.\n</ref_think>\n<ref>2</ref>\n<score_think>\nComparing the current state image to Image 2, the robotic arm is in a similar position, holding the object above the container.

The objects on the table, including the yellow object, are in a stable configuration, suggesting that the robotic arm has successfully placed the object and is no longer actively engaged in the task. The slight differences in the arm's position or the objects' arrangement do not significantly impact the overall progress, as the task's primary objective seems to have been achieved. Therefore, the current state is very close to the final state shown in the fourth demo image. </score_think>\n<score>98%</score>", "meta_data": {"id": "h5_ur_1rgb/yellow_pepper_on_table/1015_182139", "task_goal": "picking up a yellow pepper and placing it on the table", "status": "success"}}
