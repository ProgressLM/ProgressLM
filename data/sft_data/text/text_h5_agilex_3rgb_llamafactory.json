However, the image does not show the lid being placed on the pot, which would be the next step (Step 7). Therefore, the progress is slightly before Step 7 but very close to Step 6.

This state is very close to the completion of the task, as the next step (Step 7) involves moving away from the lever, which is a minor action following the lever being pushed.\n</ref_think>\n<ref>6</ref>\n<score_think>\nThe current state image is most similar to Step 6, where the lever on the toaster is pushed down. However, the robotic arm appears to be in a slightly different position compared to the description of Step 6, as it seems to be retracting or moving away from the lever. This suggests that the action of pushing the lever is completed, but the final step of moving away from the lever has not yet been fully executed. Given that the lever is already pushed down, the task is very close to completion, but not entirely finished. Therefore, the progress should be slightly less than 100%, reflecting the transition from Step 6 to Step 7.\n</score_think>\n<score>85.0</score>"

The absence of the egg in the image does not detract from the estimation, as the focus on the pot lid in the current state is consistent with the completion of Step 4.\n</score_think>\n<score>44.0</score>"

This aligns with the early stages of the task where the pot lid is being handled, and the potato is yet to be grabbed or moved. The most relevant step in the text demo is Step 3, where the pot lid is being moved towards the table, and the right hand is moving towards the potato.

However, since the pot lid is now back on the pot, it suggests that the action has not yet completed the transition to the next step (Step 4, where the potato is grabbed). The image indicates that the task is slightly further along than Step 3 but not yet at Step 4.\n\nConsidering the progression in the text demo, Step 3 is marked at 38%, and Step 4 is at 50%. Since the current state shows the pot lid back on the pot, it implies that the action of moving the lid towards the table is complete, but the next step of grabbing the potato has not yet begun.

The progress appears to be slightly ahead of Step 7, as the arm is actively moving the bowl, suggesting that the grabbing action is either complete or near completion. Given that Step 7 is associated with 78% progress, the current state is very close to this step but not quite at the point of moving the bowl toward the table, which is described in Step 8. Therefore, the progress should be slightly less than 78%, around 77%.\n</score_think>\n<score>77</score>"

This matches the progress described in Step 2 of the text_demo, where the action of picking up the carrot is about to occur or is in progress. \n\nSince the current state does not yet show the carrot being picked up, it aligns closely with the 33% progress indicated in Step 2. The absence of any further actions, such as placing the carrot on the plate or moving the plate to the tray, confirms that the task is still in its initial phase, consistent with the progress described in Step 2.\n</score_think>\n<score>33.0</score>"

This aligns with the progress of having the plate in place and moving toward the apple.\n</ref_think>\n<ref>6</ref>\n<score_think>\nThe current state image indicates that the green plate is already on the table, which corresponds to Step 4 in the text demo. However, the robot's arm is positioned near the apple, suggesting that it is about to grab the apple, which aligns with Step 6. Since the plate is already on the table and the robot is preparing to grab the apple, the progress is slightly beyond Step 4 but not yet at Step 6. Therefore, the progress is estimated to be close to 66%, as it is just before the action of grabbing the apple is completed.\n</score_think>\n<score>66</score>"

This suggests that the task is still in its early stages, where the pot lid has not been moved, and the corn cob has not been picked up. The most relevant step from the text demo would be one where the pot lid is being moved or grabbed, as this is a critical action that marks the beginning of the task.\n\nStep 4 in the text demo (\"[right] grab the corn cob\") indicates that the corn cob is being picked up, which is a significant milestone in the task. However, since the pot lid is still closed in the image, it is more likely that the task is at a stage before the corn cob is picked up. Step 3 (\"[left] moves the pot lid towards the table while [right] move towards the corn cob\") is the most relevant, as it describes the moment right before the corn cob is grabbed. This aligns well with the current state, where the pot lid is closed, and no interaction with the corn cob has occurred yet.\n\nGiven that the current state image shows the pot lid is still closed, and no actions have been taken to move it or pick up the corn cob, the progress is likely to be around the stage where the pot lid is about to be moved.

Comparing this with Step 3 in the text demo, where the pot lid is being moved towards the table, suggests that the task is at a similar stage. The progress has not yet reached the point where the corn cob is being picked up (Step 4), but it is slightly advanced beyond the initial setup (Step 1 and 2).\n\nSince the pot lid is still closed, and no significant action has been taken beyond preparing to move it, the progress is likely around the midpoint of the preparatory phase. The text demo indicates that Step 3 corresponds to 38% progress, which is slightly lower than the ground truth of 50%. However, given that the current state is closer to the point of grabbing the corn cob (Step 4), the progress is more advanced than Step 3 but not yet at Step 4. Therefore, the estimated progress should be slightly higher than 38% but below 50%.\n</score_think>\n<score>49.0</score>"

This suggests that the task of placing the avocado into the bowl has been completed, and the next logical step involves handling the bowl itself. This matches the description in Step 5 of the text demo, where the arm is moving away from the avocado and grabbing the bowl. Since the arm is actively engaging with the bowl, it indicates that the task is progressing beyond the placement of the avocado but has not yet completed the final steps, such as moving the bowl to a shelf. Therefore, the progress is consistent with the 71% mark, as the primary task of placing the avocado is done, and the secondary task of moving the bowl is underway.\n</score_think>\n<score>71.0</score>"

Therefore, Step 8 is the most relevant reference for estimating the progress. </ref_think>\n<ref>8</ref>\n<score_think> Comparing the current state image with Step 8, it is clear that the task described in the text_demo has been fully accomplished. The bowl is successfully placed on the plate, and there are no additional actions taking place. This matches the description in Step 8, where the agent has moved away from the plate after completing the task. Since the task is complete, the progress should be at the final stage. </score_think>\n<score>100.0</score>"

The open microwave and the presence of the bowl with the apple suggest that the task is progressing toward the next step, but the bowl has not yet been moved into the microwave, justifying a progress score slightly above Step 5.\n</score_think>\n<score>66.0</score>"
