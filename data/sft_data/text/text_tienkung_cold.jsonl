The image does not show any blocks being collected or prepared for stacking. Instead, it shows a robotic arm interacting with blocks that appear to already be stacked or placed on a surface.\n\n2. **Step 2 (67%): Stack the collected blocks on the base**\n   - This step involves physically stacking the blocks.
