The task involves throwing a paper ball into a trash can, and the text_demo describes a sequence of steps leading to the completion of this task. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Step 1: move towards the paper ball** (25%)\n   - This step involves approaching the paper ball. The image does not show any movement towards a paper ball, so this step is not relevant to the current state.\n\n2. **Step 2: grab the paper ball** (50%)\n   - This step involves picking up the paper ball. The image does not show any interaction with a paper ball, so this step is also not relevant.\n\n3. **Step 3: move the paper ball towards the trash can** (75%)\n   - This step involves moving the paper ball toward the trash can. The image does not show any movement of a paper ball, so this step is not relevant.\n\n4. **Step 4: move away from the paper ball** (100%)\n   - This step indicates that the task is complete, as the person has moved away from the paper ball after presumably throwing it into the trash can. The current image does not show any paper ball or trash can, but it also does not show any ongoing action related to the task. This suggests that the task might be completed.\n\nGiven that the task involves throwing a paper ball into a trash can and the image does not show any ongoing action related to this task, it is reasonable to infer that the task has been completed.
